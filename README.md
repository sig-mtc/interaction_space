# ESSA SIG-MTC
This is the information space of the European Social Simulation Association's (ESSA) Special Interest Group on Modelling Transformative Change (SIG-MTC). 

In today's rapidly changing world, social, economic, and environmental systems are increasingly subject to accelerated, transformative changes driven by climate, environmental, and socio-economic dynamics. Transformative change refers to profound, systemic shifts that radically reshape underlying structures, processes and relationships  within a system. Understanding how systems respond to shifts in behavior, policy, technology, economics, and environmental conditions – often characterized by nonlinear interactions, feedback loops, and path-dependence – is critical for policy-relevant modeling. The SIG-MTC uses agent-based modeling (ABM) to investigate how the interplay between human behavior and environment affects how societies adapt or transform under different stressors. ABM research within SIG-MTC examines a variety of topics – including land-use decision-making, economic interactions in resource markets, climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, and the distribution of impacts in complex and interconnected systems – and how these phenomena propagate across scales, from individuals to institutions or markets.

The overarching goal of the SIG-MTC is to advance our understanding of transformative changes in social and environmental systems under different stressors. The SIG may also serve for informed discourse about the normativity of the transformative change concept and the tension between global, regional, and local notions of it. We hope it will be a platform for active discussions and academic exchange and welcome anyone interested in tackling these issues using social simulation. We aim to achieve this primarily through organising thematic sessions at the annual Social Simulation Conference.
