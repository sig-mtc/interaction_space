## Ground Rules for interaction within the SIG-MTC

1. **Respectful Communication**: We treat each other with respect and courtesy in all interactions, whether in person, online, or in written communications.

2. **Constructive Feedback**: We provide feedback in a constructive manner that focuses on ideas and content rather than on individuals.

3. **Inclusive Environment**: We welcome diverse perspectives and backgrounds, ensuring everyone feels valued and able to contribute.

4. **Academic Integrity**: We properly acknowledge others' work and ideas through appropriate citations and references.

5. **Collaborative Spirit**: We approach discussions with openness to learning from each other and building on shared knowledge.

6. **Meeting Conduct**: We come prepared to meetings, respect time constraints, and ensure everyone has an opportunity to participate.

7. **Conflict Resolution**: We address disagreements directly and professionally, focusing on solutions rather than assigning blame.

8. **Knowledge Sharing**: We actively share relevant resources, tools, and research findings to advance the group's collective understanding.

9. **Confidentiality**: We respect the confidentiality of unpublished work or personal information shared within the group.

10. **Continuous Improvement**: We remain open to refining our practices and approaches as the SIG evolves.
