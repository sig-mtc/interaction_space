### Theory
#### Foundations of Transformative Change

Studying the complexity of change: Toward an analytical framework for understanding deliberate social-ecological transformations. Ecology and Society, 19(4), 54. https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06966-190454
  * This paper provides a crucial analytical framework specifically designed for understanding deliberate transformative change in social-ecological systems. It bridges theoretical concepts with practical applications and examines the role of agency in transformation processes, making it foundational for modeling transformative change.

* O'Brien, K. (2012). Global environmental change II: From adaptation to deliberate transformation. Progress in Human Geography, 36(5), 667-676. https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132511425767
  * This work conceptualizes the critical shift from adaptation to transformation in response to environmental challenges. It explores how transformation involves fundamental changes in values, behaviors, governance, and power relationships, providing essential context for modeling transformative processes.

* Feola, G. (2015). Societal transformation in response to global environmental change: A review of emerging concepts. Ambio, 44(5), 376-390. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-014-0582-z
  * This comprehensive review clarifies the diverse conceptual frameworks around societal transformation. It provides definitional clarity and identifies patterns across different approaches to transformation, which is valuable for establishing consistent modeling approaches.

#### Detection of systemic shifts
* Filatova, T., Polhill, J. G., & van Ewijk, S. (2016). Regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: Review of modelling challenges and approaches. Environmental Modelling & Software, 75, 333–347. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.04.003>
  * This paper talks about modeling challenges and possibilties in relation to regime shifts/critical transitions/structural changes. They specifically address statisical models, system dynamics models, equilibrium models and agent-based models. Furthermore, it provides an overview of different ways to detect regime shifts.

#### Agent-Based Approaches to Transformative Change
* Köhler, J., de Haan, F., Holtz, G., Kubeczko, K., Moallemi, E., Papachristos, G., & Chappin, E. (2018). Modelling sustainability transitions: An assessment of approaches and challenges. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 21(1), 8. https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3629
  * This paper evaluates various modeling approaches for sustainability transitions, with a significant focus on agent-based modeling. It identifies key challenges and opportunities in modeling transformative change, making it particularly relevant for ABM researchers within the SIG-MTC.

* Schlüter, M., Baeza, A., Dressler, G., Frank, K., Groeneveld, J., Jager, W., Janssen, M.A., McAllister, R.R.J., Müller, B., Orach, K., Schwarz, N., & Wijermans, N. (2017). A framework for mapping and comparing behavioural theories in models of social-ecological systems. Ecological Economics, 131, 21-35. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.008
  * This work provides a framework for mapping and comparing behavioral theories in social-ecological models, which is essential for accurately representing human decision-making in transformative change processes.

### Domain-specific
#### Climate Change
* Otto, I.M., Donges, J.F., Cremades, R., Bhowmik, A., Hewitt, R.J., Lucht, W., Rockström, J., Allerberger, F., McCaffrey, M., Doe, S.S.P., Lenferna, A., Morán, N., van Vuuren, D.P., & Schellnhuber, H.J. (2020). Social tipping dynamics for stabilizing Earth's climate by 2050. PNAS, 117(5), 2354-2365. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1900577117
  * This paper identifies social tipping interventions that could trigger rapid transformative change in response to climate challenges. It emphasizes the potential for nonlinear social dynamics to accelerate decarbonization, making it highly relevant for agent-based modeling of climate transformations.

#### Characteriscs of transformative adaptation
* Fedele, G., Donatti, C. I., Harvey, C. A., Hannah, L., & Hole, D. G. (2019). Transformative adaptation to climate change for sustainable social-ecological systems. Environmental Science & Policy, 101, 116–125. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2019.07.001
  * This paper reviews conceptual literature on the transformative adaptation of social-ecological systems to climate change. It highlights six key characteristics of transformative adaptation: restructuring, path-shifting, innovation, multiscale, system-wide, and persistence. The authors argue that transformative adaptation, rather than incremental adaptation, is critical for addressing the root causes of vulnerability in these systems. This work provides valuable insights for integrating transformative adaptation strategies into adaptation policies and programs across multiple scales.

* Wilson, R. S., Herziger, A., Hamilton, M., & Brooks, J. S. (2020). From incremental to transformative adaptation in individual responses to climate-exacerbated hazards. Nature Climate Change, 10(3), 200–208. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0691-6
  * This work reviews behavioral literature in relation to individual climate change adaptation. They relate individual, initially incremental adaptation action to larger, transformational adaptation. Social, and specifically agent-based simulation could provide important insights into the emergent phenomenon coming from individual adaptation behavior.

#### Socio-Economic Transformations
* Geels, F.W., Sovacool, B.K., Schwanen, T., & Sorrell, S. (2017). Sociotechnical transitions for deep decarbonization. Science, 357(6357), 1242-1244. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao3760
  * This paper examines the sociotechnical aspects of transformative change toward decarbonization. It emphasizes the interconnected nature of social, technological, and economic systems, providing important insights for modeling comprehensive transitions.

* Burch, S., Gupta, A., Inoue, C., Kalfagianni, A., Persson, Å., Gerlak, A.K., Ishii, A., Patterson, J., Pickering, J., Scobie, M., Van der Heijden, J., Vervoort, J., Adler, C., Bloomfield, M., Djalante, R., Drupp, J., Fritzen, D., Galaz, V., Gosh, A., ...Van Zeben, J. (2019). New directions in earth system governance research. Earth System Governance, 1, 100006. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esg.2019.100006
  * This paper explores governance frameworks for enabling transformative change across interconnected socio-economic systems. It offers insights into how governance structures can either enable or constrain transformative processes, which is critical for realistic agent-based modeling.
