### Theory
#### Detection of systemic shifts
* Filatova, T., Polhill, J. G., & van Ewijk, S. (2016). Regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: Review of modelling challenges and approaches. Environmental Modelling & Software, 75, 333–347. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.04.003>
  * This paper talks about modeling challenges and possibilties in relation to regime shifts/critical transitions/structural changes. They specifically address statisical models, system dynamics models, equilibrium models and agent-based models. Furthermore, it provides an overview of different ways to detect regime shifts.

### Domain-specific
#### Climate Change
* Wilson, R. S., Herziger, A., Hamilton, M., & Brooks, J. S. (2020). From incremental to transformative adaptation in individual responses to climate-exacerbated hazards. Nature Climate Change, 10(3), 200–208. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0691-6
  * This work reviews behavioral literature in relation to individual climate change adaptation. They relate individual, initially incremental adaptation action to larger, transformational adaptation. Social, and specifically agent-based simulation could provide important insights into the emergent phenomenon coming from individual adaptation behavior.
