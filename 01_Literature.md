### Theory
#### Foundations of Transformative Change
* Moore, M.L., Tjornbo, O., Enfors, E., Knapp, C., Hodbod, J., Baggio, J.A., Norström, A., Olsson, P., & Biggs, D. (2014). Studying the complexity of change: Toward an analytical framework for understanding deliberate social-ecological transformations. Ecology and Society, 19(4), 54. https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06966-190454
  * This paper provides a crucial analytical framework specifically designed for understanding deliberate transformative change in social-ecological systems. It bridges theoretical concepts with practical applications and examines the role of agency in transformation processes, making it foundational for modeling transformative change.

* O'Brien, K. (2012). Global environmental change II: From adaptation to deliberate transformation. Progress in Human Geography, 36(5), 667-676. https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132511425767
  * This work conceptualizes the critical shift from adaptation to transformation in response to environmental challenges. It explores how transformation involves fundamental changes in values, behaviors, governance, and power relationships, providing essential context for modeling transformative processes.

  * This comprehensive review clarifies the diverse conceptual frameworks around societal transformation. It provides definitional clarity and identifies patterns across different approaches to transformation, which is valuable for establishing consistent modeling approaches.

* Köhler, J., De Haan, F., Holtz, G., Kubeczko, K., Moallemi, E., Papachristos, G., & Chappin, E. (2018). Modelling sustainability transitions: an assessment of approaches and challenges. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation*, 21(1) 8, 201. https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3629
  * This paper provides a comprehensive review of modelling approaches relevant to sustainability transitions and identifies the key characteristics such models must address—including non-linearity, normative change, and structural reconfiguration. It is highly relevant to the challenge of modelling ontological change, as it explicitly calls for innovative models capable of representing the co-evolution of values, institutions, and technologies during profound societal transformations. Notably, it critiques the limitations of dominant modelling approaches like energy-economy models, which struggle to represent qualitatively different system states without relying on exogenous inputs—highlighting a key barrier to simulating endogenous ontological change (see section 3.7).

* Gotts, N.M., van Voorn, G.A., Polhill, J.G., de Jong, E., Edmonds, B., Hofstede, G.J. and Meyer, R. (2019). Agent-based modelling of socio-ecological systems: Models, projects and ontologies. *Ecological Complexity*, *40*, p.100728. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2018.07.007
  * This paper argues for greater attention to social complexity in SES models, emphasizing that human agents can deliberately reshape the structure and dynamics of the systems they inhabit - introducing new forms of complexity and challenging static modelling assumptions. Especially relevant to ontological change, the paper proposes using formal ontologies within modelling projects to make model structure, scope, and assumptions explicit, enabling clearer reflection on how models relate to evolving conceptualisations of the system.

* Polhill, J.G., Hare, M., Bauermann, T., Anzola, D., Palmer, E., Salt, D. and Antosz, P. (2021). Using agent-based models for prediction in complex and wicked systems. *Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation*, *24*(3). https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4597
  * This paper uses two computational thought experiments to argue that while complexity alone does not render prediction formally impossible, wicked systems—which exhibit both complexity and ontological uncertainty—pose more profound challenges. Central to the argument is the concept of endogenous ontological novelty, where novel system states, agents, or symbols emerge dynamically, making long-term prediction unreliable or meaningless. Especially relevant to modelling ontological change, the paper highlights the need for modelling approaches that can respond to and potentially represent emergent, unanticipated system configurations.

* Polhill, J.G., Filatova, T., Schlüter, M. and Voinov, A. (2016). Modelling systemic change in coupled socio-environmental systems. *Environmental Modelling & Software*, *75*, pp.318-332. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.10.017
  * This paper offers a foundational framing for understanding and modelling systemic change, introducing the idea that such change often entails reconfigurations of a model’s ontology, including its entities, relationships, and processes. It argues that true systemic change may require new modelling vocabularies and structures - what they term ΔL (language change), ΔP (process change), and ΔE (entity state change) systemic changes - which go beyond parameter adjustment and into qualitative redefinition of system boundaries and logics. Especially relevant for modelling ontological change, the paper contends that many current models are inadequate for simulating transformative dynamics because they assume static ontologies, and it calls for models that can evolve their representational structure in response to emergent, endogenous processes.

Rasmussen (Eds.), *Artificial life XII: Proceedings of the 12th international conference on the synthesis and simulation of living systems* (pp. 669–676). MIT Press. https://aaai.org/papers/0011-ss03-02-011-evolving-cultural-things-that-think/
  * This paper is an early and ambitious call to develop computational models of *artificial culture* capable of representing the distributed, emergent, and adaptive nature of human cognition and social life. While it stops short of offering concrete modelling tools, it highlights the potential of evolutionary computation to support the study of ontological change by enabling agents to reconfigure meaning, representation, and strategy in heterogeneous, multi-scalar environments.

  * This paper introduces the concept of wicked systems - social systems that are not only complex and adaptive, but also ontologically unstable, with evolving agents, rules, and categories. It offers a sharp critique of complexity science’s reliance on persistent entities and system boundaries, arguing that “on the time scales of sociotechnical change almost everything in society *really is* ‘changing with everything else’ (Malerba, 2005),” making such assumptions untenable. Especially relevant for modelling ontological change, the paper calls for approaches that can accommodate the reflexive, co-constitutive, and meaning-laden dynamics of social systems, where what exists and what matters are always in flux.

  * This paper identifies social tipping interventions that could trigger rapid transformative change in response to climate challenges. It emphasizes the potential for nonlinear social dynamics to accelerate decarbonization, making it highly relevant for agent-based modeling of climate transformations.

* Fedele, G., Donatti, C. I., Harvey, C. A., Hannah, L., & Hole, D. G. (2019). Transformative adaptation to climate change for sustainable social-ecological systems. Environmental Science & Policy, 101, 116–125. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2019.07.001
  * This paper reviews conceptual literature on the transformative adaptation of social-ecological systems to climate change. It highlights six key characteristics of transformative adaptation: restructuring, path-shifting, innovation, multiscale, system-wide, and persistence. The authors argue that transformative adaptation, rather than incremental adaptation, is critical for addressing the root causes of vulnerability in these systems. This work provides valuable insights for integrating transformative adaptation strategies into adaptation policies and programs across multiple scales.

  * This work reviews behavioral literature in relation to individual climate change adaptation. They relate individual, initially incremental adaptation action to larger, transformational adaptation. Social, and specifically agent-based simulation could provide important insights into the emergent phenomenon coming from individual adaptation behavior.
