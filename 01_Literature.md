### Theory
#### Detection of systemic shifts
* Filatova, T., Polhill, J. G., & van Ewijk, S. (2016). Regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: Review of modelling challenges and approaches. Environmental Modelling & Software, 75, 333–347. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.04.003>
  * This paper talks about modeling challenges and possibilties in relation to regime shifts/critical transitions/structural changes. They specifically address statisical models, system dynamics models, equilibrium models and agent-based models. Furthermore, it provides an overview of different ways to detect regime shifts.

### Domain-specific
#### Climate Change
* Fedele, G., Donatti, C. I., Harvey, C. A., Hannah, L., & Hole, D. G. (2019). Transformative adaptation to climate change for sustainable social-ecological systems. Environmental Science & Policy, 101, 116–125. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2019.07.001
 *  This paper reviews conceptual literature on the transformative adaptation of social-ecological systems to climate change. It highlights six key characteristics of transformative adaptation: restructuring, path-shifting, innovation, multiscale, system-wide, and persistence. The authors argue that transformative adaptation, rather than incremental adaptation, is critical for addressing the root causes of vulnerability in these systems. This work provides valuable insights for integrating transformative adaptation strategies into adaptation policies and programs across multiple scales.

* Wilson, R. S., Herziger, A., Hamilton, M., & Brooks, J. S. (2020). From incremental to transformative adaptation in individual responses to climate-exacerbated hazards. Nature Climate Change, 10(3), 200–208. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0691-6
  * This work reviews behavioral literature in relation to individual climate change adaptation. They relate individual, initially incremental adaptation action to larger, transformational adaptation. Social, and specifically agent-based simulation could provide important insights into the emergent phenomenon coming from individual adaptation behavior.
